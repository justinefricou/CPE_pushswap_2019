The game is based on two lists of numbers, named l_a and l_b. In the beginning, l_b will be empty and l_a will contain a certain amount of positive or negative integers. The objective of the game is to sort l_a.  In order to accomplish this, the program only uses the three operations (pa, which takes the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list ; pb, which takes the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list ; ra, which rotates l_a toward the beginning: the first element will become the last). The program takes the list l_a as parameter and displays every operations used, in the right order.  The bonus folder contains a version of this program which handles integers as well as float numbers.
